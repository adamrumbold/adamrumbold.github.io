---------------------------

Friday 2.6.1995

Left Hobart airport in a poky Ansett plane and flew to Sydney. Arrived at Sydney airport about 8pm and then took a tax to the Abcott motor inn. Although supposedly close to the airport it was a 20-30 minute drive. We (David Keller, Andrew Bishop, Tim Wheelan and myself) all shared a room.

Saturday 3.6.1995

6:00am morning, showers etc then off to the airport. Checked our bags in, then had a McDonalds breakfast. Trhough customs, then onto ANA flight 914, in a big Boing 747. The flight was interesting, with a television screen showing movies and a map of the planes progress. The flight took 9 hours, and we arrived at Narita airport at 5:30pm. We were then bused to the main bulding where we passed customs, and met Mr Taguch, Mr Yamamoto and Mr __ (Joker). We then all took a limosine bus into the metropolitan hotel. The rde took 2 hours because of traffic. We were then given a huge Japanese banquet. It was a huge meal, with many courses and exotic foods.

Sun 4.6.1995

The morning began at 7:00. We were then wandering around for breakfast and ended up having McDonalds. We then wandered all around, getting thoroughly lost, and looking at all the shops, and ack street alleys. Taguchi and  Yamamoto san then took us to Ikebukurto dai-ichi primary school (Howrah's sister school). There was an athletics carnival on, with a great amount of colour, movement and games. We were then gien a formal lunch with us all sitting on the ground. The carnival finished at 3pm, we then had more food and then came back to the hotel. We all then visitied TOBU andMitsukoshi which are department stores before going to Tacko Balls for tea. The balls were cooked by us, and contained fruit. They were beautiful. We then retired very tired to bed. 
* Called Tacko Yachi

Monday 5.6.1995

Today started at 7am with a run with Mr Hall. We then found MacD for breakfast before heading to the Toshma city offices. Walked through the dilapidated buildings and met the mayor. We then changed and left for our tour. Our first visit was a shrine with markets and many shoppers, with was very ornamental. We paid for our fortunes before heading to the ginza. We then had lunch in a traditional Japanese restaurant before heading to the very expensive Ginza shops. We then visited the fish markets and walked through many small alley shops. We were then driven around the imperial palace, which is the emporers residence with very large grounds. We then visited the tallest building in Japan the building was about 45 stories high. We then had a 30minute rest at the hotel before heading to ur formal welcome dinner.

We had a very interesting dinner and made a speech each. The food was light, and there was much conversation.

Tuesday 6.6.1995

We all awoke very tired and anxious to meet our billets. We ate breakfast at the hotels restaurant, and I had very nice waffles. We then all packed and checked out of the Metropolitan hotel before meeting Mr Taguchi and Yamamoto for a tour of Toshima-ku. We visited an old all girtls school designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and then we visited the 'hazard' building; and experienced the feelings of an earthquake, smoke filled room and fire. We then visited the sunshine building. It was over 200m tall, and contained shops and offices. We all then headed off to an Italian restaurant for  lunch.

We then visited the aquarium which was very spectacular. Next we went to the oriental museum. At 4:30 we met Shō and his mother, and then I headed back to his house. Their house is very nice and quite western, and Shō's mother is very nice. Shotaro's sister speaks a lot of English and Shō's has improved. His grandmother lives on the 1st floor, and we are on the 2nd. We had a nice dinner of rice, potato and cream in batter, tofu (bean curd) and salmon. We showed each other photo's and presents. Sho and I also played soccer on his Nintendo. We then went to sleep at 11pm.

Wed 7.6.1995

Woke at 7, and then had a nice english breakfast of toast, small sausages, eggs and salad. We left for school at 8:10 and walked for about 3 minutes. We then visited the principal and deputy princpal, and I addressed the staff and then the students at assembly. There was a lot of interest in me, and the school was very noisy, playful and at time undisciplined. The students would talk and sometimes sleep wthout the teachers worry. We firstly had maths, then history, Japanese, music, lunch maths. School finished at 2:40 and then we walked back to Shō's house. We then had a party with all the Toshima-ku students who came to Tasmania last year. It was good to meet Masahuru and Dushi. We were all given presents and at 5:30 we left and went to a Judo class. We then headed home where  met Mr Kashima and we had a nice Japanese tea of squid, breans, pepper in batter and sushi. Very tired I went to sleep at 10:45.

Thu 7.6.1995

We had breakfast downstairs today and it was very nice, with an omellete ham and salad. Yet again we headed off to school and we arrived early. There was no assembly and yet again all the girls were 'bakko' (foolish). Although a few were quite hospitable and tried conversations. During the day we had history, English, Japanese, science and P.E. During P.E we had a relay and then a game of soccer. They were all very impressed by my soccer skills and while doing the warmup laps all the girls were watching me and waving. When I waved back there was a huge roar. After school we went to the Toshma city offices for a chat and then we went back to the house and had a birtthday cake for Shō. His birthday is on the 10th. His friends and us then took the soccer ball and the football and had a kick in the park. It was good fun to play soccer and football. We then had a nice tea of beef (which costs $80 for 100gm), tomato, fried onion, eggplant and pepper. Then we had a stirfry. After tea Shō and I went to his English club which was a small room where a nice man taught 50 students. We had a game of diamonds (similar to Chinese chekers) and had a good chat. We then came home, I had a bath and zzzz.

Sat 10.6.95. 

We had a nice sleep in this morning (10am) and then I had chicken balls and pears for breaky. I also met Shō's uncle who showed me the camera's. After breaky we went to akihabara where I saw the camera. Then we went to Parco and had a look at the CD shop which took up two levels. I then watched Shō's soccer game where he won 4-0. They played at the school David went to and they played on gravel. We then grabbed McDonalds for lunch before drving to Yokohama. The traffic was very slow and we passed through about 5 tunnels on teh way and two big bridges. On the way there was much dustrial and trade activity. In Yokohama we went trhough a market and we had tea at a Chinese restaurant. We then had shellfs, lobster, fried rice, noodles and spring rolls. We then drove back home at 8:30pm.

We then drove to a garden like the botannical gardens but not uite as nice. We then drove home where I said goodbye to the uncle, gran etc. and we left to go to the hotel Metropolitan. Once there I said goodbye to the Kashima's and we left for an informal lunch. It was a nice lunch of shrimps, dim sims (chicken) and fried rice. We then changed and took a train to a station where we caught the train to Narita. At the station some girls came to see us off. We had a relxing ride to Narita and then had a 4 hour wait until our plane. We said goodbye to Taguch, Yamamoto & __ (Daves principal). We finally boarded the plan and had a nice pissfart on the plane, only gaining 30min shut eye.
