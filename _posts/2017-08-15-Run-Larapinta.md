Back on new years day - when work was still nuts - I committed to [Run Larapinta](http://ascent.com.au/runlarapinta/). A four day stage race out across the Larapinta trail in outback central Australia. The escape and challenge was something to look forward to. A few days ago with heatstroke and an absolutely spent body I could curse this stunning race - but now back at home I feel I have unfinished business on the trail and a desire to be out in those amazing and remote mountains again. Run Larapinta 2018 anyone?

I decided to get into Alice Springs a day early so as to not be rushed and have a bit of time to check out the town. The first afternoon I grabbed some supplies from the supermarket and shuddered at the hot 27 degree heat and forecast 30 degree race days. This was going to hurt as I've always run hot and needed some cooler air to stop me forming into a hot dripping mess above a massive puddle. That night I checked out the recommended Monty's which indeed was a nice venue - and early the next day wandered out to the nicer caf√©s in the Todd mall. I'd been told if I had time to do one thing in Alice to head to the Desert Park - which I did and was indeed a great few hours to learn about the flora and fauna in central australia and view an impressive native bird show.

Friday afternoon was registration and briefing time - before a 5:30 dusk run around the trails behind Alice Sprngs. The organisers quite rightly impressed the need to manage yourself and forget about your time for the next few days. It was an environment where you would be asked to take a concrete pill. Bail out points were few and far between - so being highly reslient, self supporting and able to self rescue yourself out of a bad situation was crucial. As reality set in we all sat out our nerves and made our way to the late afternoon start line for day 1.

Day 1 - 19km from Alice Springs to the Old Telegraph Station
------------------------------------------------------------

Starting on a sandy river bed - we followed a dusty fire trail behind the suburbs of Alice for a few k's before turning off into the flowing single trail used by the moutain bikers around Alice. With beautifully framed ranges, the setting sun and fresh legs it was a delightful spin. Before long I was tucked behind a group not far off the lead, and enjoying the evening so much I decided to keep the tempo pace for the night. It was a fast pace but not uncomfortable - and as always I was spurred on by the fading light and fun trails. 

When the light was so low I was at risk of triping - I stopped to strap on my Ayups and used the opportunity for a quick photo opportunity

As I slung my pack back on out flew my phone and smashed it's screen on the ground. Ooops. Back cruising I rejoined the gang I'd been running with - a couple of blokes from Portsea in southern Victoria. It wasn't long and we were intermingled with the Namitjera (short course) stage runners. Most were pretty aware and quickly parted to allow us to bomb on through - others needed a friendly "passing" call, and a few were oblivious as we kept the buners on and flew past. 

Before too long we were down to the Telegraph Station with cowbells, cheering and a finishing chute. Home in 6th place, and a snappy 5:07/k pace - fully aware this would not last through the next few days.

Day 2 - 41km from Standley Chasm to Ormiston Gorge
--------------------------------------------------

In the pre-dawn chill we rolled out of Alice Springs for the start of a big day 2. It was forecast to be unseasonaly hot - 30 degrees. Since there was only two aid stations (at 16k and at 28k) and as the final stretch from 28k was hard the organisers had set expectations that all runners had to leave that second aid station with a minimum of 3l of water. This seemed at the time like it was being overly cautious - 3L to run out the final 11ks - how naive many of us were!

The start line was in front of Stanley Chasm gorge. It was beautful albeit freezing at dawn - with a huddled crew of about 40-50 runners eager to have our first big day out - and start warming up. From the start an easy pace was set and there was some beautiful undulating single track as we moved out along the trail. I soon again picked my natural spot tucked in behind Nathan and Shagger from day 1 and Aaron. Aaron was out raising money and awareness for the Black Dog charity for mental health and depression. Travelling around outback Australia and running 8 marathons in 8 months. He'd toed the line at the Tawoomba marathon only the weekend previous and after four hard days and two marathons in the Malbunka couse or the Run Larapinta race he was due to back up with the Alice Springs marathon the next weekend. A humble and natural runner - and one of the many quiet legends you meet out on the trails.

The day started heating up soon after the sun was out - and by the first checkpoint at the 18k mark it was already feeling pretty warm. I was still feeling great - so grabbed a water top up and quickly pressed on to the 28k station. By about 25k mark it was getting hot and the legs were starting to feel a bit heavy, then we turned the corner to the 'Fishing Hole' which was nothing but a dry river bed of sand and stones that needed to be walked through. The 28k station was a few ks up the river bed - and just when it was in view we had a pinchy climb up over and down a ridge to get to it. By now it was hot!

I took my time at the aid station - some water on the head, some refills and making sure I had 3 litres, and a quick nigari roll with soy sauce that hit the spot. Just as I was leaving I saw some folks I'd droped at the 16k station - so pressed on. 13k to go - this shouldn't be too bad - oh how wrong was!

The climb started soon after, but was mostly gently for a few kilometers. Then we started the real climb. It was here that I started to see others reel me in - first Nathan and Shagger were past. Then came a few more. By this stage I was feeling it - a power hike up with this steepness and the heat was getting too much and I had to take a few pit stops to bring the heartrate back down. There was a breeze flowing as we rose higher which was delightful and help contain the body temperature somewhat.

The climb up the ride was only a few kms but took me over an hour! For me a power hike should be 12-15 km/hour but up here I was taking over 30 minutes per hour - and I'd realised now the day was baking hot that the aim was to complete not to kill myself. Once finally over the peak the top of the ridge was highly technical which meant little running was possible.. The bit that was runnable I kicked a stone that didn't move and couldn't correct myself soon enough, biting the dust hard. After the quick check to find what was injured and how bad - I saw it was mostly my pride and some decent skin off my elbow and hand. Luckily I could still run - I just had to work out how to get up again without cramping. Something that was becoming increasingly present - but mostly manageable. I rolled up  - and found a million spinefex grass needless poking out of my skin, clothes and pack. It took a good 20 minutes to pick them all out  - and in doing so I realised a few had pierced my 2L Platypus bladder and my 500ml body bottle. Fortunately they were not leaking and only did so if squeezed. That could have been a lot worse.

As I came down off the ridge the descent was into a beautiful green gully with a nice variety of treest and plants. It was at this stage the trail started to get a bit indistinct and you had to keep your wits to ensure you stayed on the trail. I took the opportunity to take a 5 minute rest in the shade and keep hydrating. Something like 5ks to go - again thinking that's a doddle to walk out - but again not recognising the fun the trail had yet.

Soon after there was an indistince and unmarked junction. The 'natural' direction straight on led to a river bank.. I stayed straight for about 10 metres, but my watch and the map I'd just re-read when taking a break indicated a right direction was required. I corrected one runner who was pretty sure I was on the right path to go right, and then 3 more who came up to the junction. Later that night I learnt that a number of runners made the same mistake a few of us almost did. Some carrying on for another hour and half to the same junction over the high pass, and turning a 41k epic day into a 50k monster.

Day 3 - DNS
-----------

Day 3 was meant to be an easy day. 30kms from xx to yy. However from 5am the next morning when I awoke I knew I was too weak to toe the line. The previous days effort, tight crampy legs overnight, heatstroke and 24 hours of not being able to eat real food meant I was not comfortable facing the heat again. I was glad I did as I watched the crew take of at 8:15 in the morning with the day already starting to warm up.

I then carried on with our bags and a few other supporters onto the Glen Helen homestead. Nestled in front of a beautiful cliff wall with the only remaining water in the Todd River since it last rained 6 months ago the homestead was just that, a proper bush retreat from the harsh outback. I grabbed a much needed breakfast and caught a lift with an organiser onto the finish point of the short and long course.  Myself and a few others then sat and chatted under a large shelter as the short course runners ran through 13ks into their 21k course, with a loop around Ormiston gorge to complete their day. It was getting hot and I was still slowly regaining strength after yesterday - so I had no regrets from siting the day out.
